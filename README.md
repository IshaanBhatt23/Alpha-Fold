# Protein Analysis Projects

This repository contains two separate projects addressing distinct problem statements in the field of protein analysis:

## Folder Structure

1. **Protein_Family_Classification**  
   This folder contains code and resources to classify a protein into known structural or functional families based on its amino acid sequence.

2. **Small_Molecule_Docking_Scoring**  
   This folder contains code and models for scoring candidate drug molecules to predict their binding affinity to a target protein, using simplified docking approaches.

Feel free to explore each folder for detailed implementations and instructions related to the respective problem statement.
